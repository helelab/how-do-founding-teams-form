### Model introduction

- Elements: (definition)

### Model scope
What it does:
- Spot patterns in founding team formation processes. 
- Classify any given text provided by co-founders according to its most relevant element. 

### Conclusions from the experiment:
1) The more classes we use, the bigger the dataset should be to avoid underfitting.
2) Longer sentences may be harder to train using the current LSTM model configuration.
3) In turn, longer sentences are harder to manually classify (label) because i) they may belong to different categories simultaneously, ii) they may be prone to subjective interpretations.
4) As a consequence, differences across labels may lead to higher model errors.
5) Potential measures to minimize model error:
  i) Rely on a bigger training set.
  ii) Get different human annotators label the same training set and then homogenize results by settling up label mismatches according to the majority rule.
6) Given that we are using a word-to-vec encoding, the model does not take puntuation into account. Hence, sentence interpretation may be affected.
7) The "sentence length paradox": Shorter sentences (3 - 5 words aprox.) are more suitable for training purposes, but longer sentences (5 - 20 words aprox.) were the most common sentences found during the web scraping process, which suggest we should adjust the model for longer sentence training.

The scope of the web scraping process was limited to search results using the following sentences:
- "How do you meet a cofounder?"
- "How did you meet your cofounder?"
- "Cofounder stories"
- "Searching for a cofounder"
- "Cofounder failure stories"

* Note: Indeed, a good model relies on the quality of the data you feed it with, which is why data curation is a key process worth exploring further. 

### IMPORTANCE:
The LSTM model is anchored on the 10 Prepositions as described in the research paper. 
This LSTM model will contribute in the following ways:
- Spot patterns in founding team formation processes.
- Set the ground for experimental testing of key research hypotheses.

### FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS:
- Automated web scraping and data cleansing to conduct experiments at a big scale
- Char-to-vec encodings for higher granularity
- Speech-to-text applications for automated audio transcripts using Google's APIs. This may be useful if in-depth interviews are to be conducted.
