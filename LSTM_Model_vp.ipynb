    "The process through which entrepreneurial founding teams 'reach the starting line' has become a subject of academic study and interest in recent years. Building upon existing academic literature on venture team formation, Professors David Clough and Balagopal Vissa developed a theoretical model which provides novel insights on how a set of cofounders come together to form the initial founding team [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the work developed by the authors is grounded on the following pillars:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Disaggregating the cofounder searching and evaluation process into separate entities to analyze in more depth how and when task competence and interpersonal fit affect the founding team formation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Conceiving founding team formation as a dynamic choice process that takes a middle stance between the more recent \"agentic view\" (i.e. entrepreneurs acting strategically as \"players\" within their networks) and the more traditional structuralist approach (i.e. entrepreneurs as passive occupants of social structural positions).\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Using a process-focused perspective to depict different founding team formation pathways, distilling the factors that drive both successful attempts in founding team formation and the subsequent churn when cofounder entry/exit dynamics emerge in the founding team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking to construct an experiment upon which the model's key assumptions and prepositions could be tested on, we decided to develop an LSTM Neural Network that uses an Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to process testimonies shared by entrepreneurs about their experiences on founding team formation. Several paragraphs were scraped from open forums websites such as Quora and entrepreneurial websites such as Y Combinator, looking to build a training set that resembles how entrepreneurs express themselves in real-life settings when faced with the question on how they met their co-founders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of an answer provided by a Quora user on the question \"How did you meet your co-founder?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/quora2.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the text \"machine readable\", the testimonies were broken down into individual sentences and subsequently turned into vectors of indices through a Python function. Once the sentences have been correctly set to work as inputs for the LSTM Neural Network, a layer of pre-trained vectors is loaded into the model using the GloVe 50-dimensional model developed by the Stanford NLP group (https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a 2-layer LSTM Neural Network with an additional hidden layer and a Softmax activation function is configured using the Keras Framework to process the inputs and classify the sentences according to the class definition described below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Class [0]:</b> The entrepreneur gives (or has given) more weight to elements like chemistry, trust and personal bonding when evaluating a prospective cofounder.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Class [1]:</b> The entrepreneur gives (or has given) more weight to elements like technical competences, past experience and execution capabilities when evaluating a prospective cofounder.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Class [2]:</b> The entrepreneur looks (or has looked) for connections with whom she has strong ties when looking out for a potential cofounder (Serendipitous FOCIs).\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Class [3]:</b> The entrepreneur actively looks (or has looked) within her professional networks and/or engages in a dedicated search when looking out for a potential cofounder (Goal-directed FOCIs).\n",
    "\n",
    "These classes were developed taking into account propositions #1, #2, #3 and #4 as described in the research paper, narrowing down our focus to the process followed by founders when they \"search for and mutually evaluate\" one another. Each sentence uploaded into the training set was carefully labelled to accurately represent the most appropriate class. Given that some sentences could be categorized into two different classes based on subjective claims by the human annotator (i.e. the sentence \"Evaluate whether you are able to work well together\" may be classified as both [0] and [1]), we estimate a human error level of ≈ 10%.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, the model has been able to correctly identify ≈ 97% of the examples in the training set (n = 938), and ≈ 77% of the examples in the test set (n = 44, accounting for data the model has never \"seen\"), which implies some work has yet to be done to chop down overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model has the potential to provide a reliable framework upon which experiments at big scales can be conducted, looking to test the principal hypotheses and prepositions exposed by the conceptual framework. Concretely, the model could help to advance the theoretical research developed by Prof. Clough and Prof. Vissa by using an NLP model to systematically web-scrape, classify and spot patterns among founder testimonies and evaluate them according to the stated prepositions.\n",
